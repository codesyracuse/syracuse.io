## Join Us In Person

Syracuse has a vibrant tech community with regular meetups where developers, designers, and tech enthusiasts gather to learn, share, and connect.

### Our Meetups

**[OpenHack](/groups/open-hack)**: Our most popular recurring event. Bring your laptop and work on personal projects, get help with code, or just hang out with fellow developers. No agenda, no presentations—just collaborative coding and conversation. Great for all skill levels.

**[Computer Science Book Club](/groups)**: Read and discuss computer science books, from classics to modern texts. Deepen your understanding of fundamental concepts and cutting-edge topics.

**[Dev Drinks](/groups/dev-drinks)**: Casual social gatherings at local bars and restaurants. Network in a relaxed atmosphere without the pressure of technical discussions (though they often happen anyway!).

**[Syracuse JavaScript Meetup](/groups/syr-js)**: Deep dives into JavaScript, TypeScript, and web development. Learn about new frameworks, best practices, and modern tooling.

**And More**: Additional meetups for specific technologies, networking events, and community gatherings. Check our [full events calendar](/groups) for the latest.

### What to Expect

- **All skill levels welcome**: From beginners to experts, everyone belongs
- **No pressure**: Come as you are—listen, participate, or just observe
- **Real connections**: Meet the people you chat with on Slack
- **Free to attend**: Our meetups are free and open to the community
- **Inclusive environment**: We follow a [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) to ensure everyone feels welcome
