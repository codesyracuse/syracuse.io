    "description": "Through my connection with Hugo Acosta of CNY Latino he has offered us 10 free tickets for a Syracuse Mets game!!!\n\nLets go with Friday, July 25 where the Mets play the Omaha Storm Chasers. The first 1,000 fans in attendance will receive Christmas Jersey Giveaway! Special Appearance by Santa Clause & his Elves! After the game, fans can enjoy a post-game fireworks show!\n\nLets meet somewhere at 6pm (won't get the freebie as probably have to show at 4) and gather as a group. We'll firm up the details as we get closer. First pitch is at 6:35.\n\nParking is NOT free. I think it's $5. Or you can park at Destiny or in the neighborhood south of the ballpark and walk over (I've done it). Or you can bike which I will.

The first 1\\,000 fans in attendance will receive a specialty 2024 Syracuse Mets foldable card set giveaway\\! After the game\\, fans can enjoy a post\\-game fireworks show\\! \\| Presented By Burdick Mitsubishi at Driver's Village\\.\n\nLets meet somewhere at 6pm (won't get the free card thing as you probably have to show at 4) and gather as a group. We'll firm up the details as we get closer. First pitch is at 6:35.\n\nParking is NOT free. I think it's $5. Or you can park at Destiny or in the neighborhood south of the ballpark and walk over (I've done it). Or you can bike in which I will. They do have bicycle racks.\n\nIf it goes well, maybe this can be an annual event.",

This chat will help to inform and guide you on your journey. We'll cover the following:\n\n* New laws to be aware for developers, designers, content creators, managers, or business owners.\n* The technical requirements for websites, mobile applications, and conventional electronic document.\n* Does this really effect you or your business?\n* What is the timeline for meeting the new requirements?\n* What resources are available to help?\n\nWomen In Coding hosts a monthly meetup on the second Saturday of the month. Each month we'll be teaching and group programming in a different language/topic. Usually no previous coding experience is necessary, although some familiarity with basic HTML and CSS can be helpful.\n\nBig thank you to CODES (codesyracuse.org) for sponsoring our meetups.",

They even have small meeting rooms if you need to take a meeting while you're there!\n\nThe TCGPlayer tour and lunch are optional but will be a great chance to see how a local technology company runs! The rough plan is to head over around lunch time, get a tour of both their unique offices & their partially automated Authentication center, then hear from one of their technical teams while enjoying a complimentary lunch while we talk, ask questions, etc\u2026.\n\nTo speed the process, we\u2019ll need to gather the names and emails of those that want to go on the tour, although we can handle some unplanned attendees it will just save us some time.\n\nPlease RSVP, and if there are any questions - just ask!\n\nSee you there,\nJay\n\n[1] [https://careers.tcgplayer.com/about-us](https://careers.tcgplayer.com/about-us)\n[2] [https://www.commonspace.com/work](https://www.commonspace.com/work)",

The folks over at **Common Space have agreed to waive the daily fee for this group!**\n\nThere is no obligation to stay the whole time, and there are enclave rooms available if you need to take a meeting and need some privacy.

But throughout the 1960s and 1970s a diverse group of teachers and students working together on academic computing systems conducted many of the activities we now recognize as personal and social computing. Their networks were centered in New Hampshire, Minnesota, and Illinois, but they connected far-flung users. Joy Rankin draws on detailed records to explore how users exchanged messages, programmed music and poems, fostered communities, and developed computer games like The Oregon Trail. These unsung pioneers helped shape our digital world, just as much as the inventors, garage hobbyists, and eccentric billionaires of Palo Alto.\n\nBy imagining computing as an interactive commons, the early denizens of the digital realm seeded today\u2019s debate about whether the internet should be a public utility and laid the groundwork for the concept of net neutrality. Rankin offers a radical precedent for a more democratic digital culture, and new models for the next generation of activists, educators, coders, and makers.\"",

Each month we'll be teaching and group programming in a different language/topic. Usually no previous coding experience is necessary, although some familiarity with basic HTML and CSS can be helpful.\n\nBig thank you to Hack Upstate (hackupstate.com) and CODES (codesyracuse.org) for sponsoring our meetups.",

    "description": "ABOUT THE TALK\nNx is a monorepo tool for building software projects. Domain Driven Design (DDD) is a theoretical framework for organizing projects. Modern software development is a team sport. Combining Nx and DDD you can help your team work together by focussing on different layers of the application. You can create a coherent onboarding ramp for anyone being introduced into a large project without needing to write documentation. You can automatically enforce boundaries using a plugin for Nx that puts DDD into practice. In this talk you will be shown the path towards blissful teamwork. Will you choose to walk it?\n\nSend a question to peterbutlersmith@gmail.com with the text \"SYR(JS)\" in the subject and I will answer it on the Zoom, record it, and publish it for everyone.\n\nABOUT THE SPEAKER\nPeter B Smith is an entrepreneur. He resides in Syracuse, NY. At Upstate Interactive he implements large software applications with his team. He is a contributor to the Nx DDD plugin and puts DDD into practice for Upstate Interactive's clients.\n\nIMPORTANT TO KNOW\nThis is a harassment-free meetup, regardless of topic.",

We will also discuss examples of how the social blockchain is being implemented including digital assets (creators with their own cryptocurrency or \"social tokens\") and organizations (decentralized communities without any leaders such as DAOs).\n\nThe blockchain is an immutable system of records of transactions that are maintained across several computers that are linked to a decentralized peer-to-peer network. Incentives, usually via the distribution of cryptocurrency, encourages people to maintain and utilize the blockchain.\n\nThe social blockchain refers to the application of social use cases on the blockchain, including games, social media applications, and community engagement platforms. For example, Microsoft is now using the blockchain to record contract creation, payment, and reconciliation transactions associated with gaming rights on its gaming platforms.\n\nThe video conference link will be emailed to people who RSVP within 24 hours of the meetup.",

Please be mindful of your proximity to others, and don't attend if you're feeling unwell.\n\n(While held at a brewery, please consider attending even if you don't drink)\n\nAlso, important to know\n* Please review our Code of Conduct before attending: http://openhacksyr.com/code_of_conduct/",

Learning JavaScript is a logical next step once you've learned HTML/CSS. Our classes are open to everyone, so please share and bring a friend!\n***Please register at https://www.fflib.org/women-coding-workshop-javascript\n\nThis course is especially designed for beginners new to programming concepts, like variables, data types and functions. It will also introduce the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to use it to change html pages. Students will exit this class with a good grasp of basic programming principles and the knowledge of how to manipulate HTML elements.\n\nPREREQUISITES\nIt would be best to have a working knowledge of HTML for this class. There are many online resources to learn HTML, including this free course from Code Academy: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web\n\nBig thank you to Hack Upstate for sponsoring our meetups.
